# Anxiety: The Silent Battle of First Responders

## **Defining Anxiety**

Anxiety is a normal and often healthy emotion. However, when a person regularly feels disproportionate levels of anxiety, it might become a medical disorder. Anxiety disorders can lead to excessive nervousness, fear, apprehension, and worry. For first responders, the high-intensity nature of your work can often precipitate such feelings, potentially leading to an anxiety disorder.

### **The High Stakes Environment**

The pressures of being a first responder can fuel feelings of anxiety. Regular exposure to distressing situations, the need for quick decision-making, and the responsibility of others' lives can contribute to chronic anxiety. Remember, acknowledging your feelings is the first step towards managing them.
