# Depression among Heroes: Let's Unmask the Truth

## **Defining Depression**

Depression is more than just feeling sad or going through a rough patch. It's a serious mental health condition that requires understanding, treatment, and a good deal of self-care. For first responders, who regularly encounter high-stress situations and traumatic events, the risk of experiencing depression can be significantly higher than in other professions.

### **The Burden of Bravery**

As first responders, your role often demands high levels of bravery, resilience, and stoicism. However, the expectation to be 'tough' or 'invincible' can prevent individuals from seeking help, exacerbating feelings of isolation and depression. Remember, acknowledging your feelings isn't a sign of weakness â€” it's a part of being human and a critical step toward healing.
